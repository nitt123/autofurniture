Autofurniture is a plugin for NexoFurniture that makes furniture behave realistically:

Ground furniture breaks when the block under it is destroyed.

Air furniture breaks when the block above it is destroyed.

Some furniture IDs can be set to always break automatically.

/autofurniture reload → reloads the config.

/autofurniture add <ground|air> <ID> → add furniture to ground/air list.

/autofurniture remove <ground|air> <ID> → remove furniture from ground/air list.
